/*
Stack of Plates

Imagine a (literal) stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might topple. 
Thereforem in real-life, we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack 
exceeds some threshold.

Implement a data structure 'SetOfStacks' that mimics this.

'SetOfStacks' should be composed of several stacks once the previous one exceeds capacity.
SetOfStacks.push() and SetOfStacks.pop() should behave identically to a single stack.

---------

Implement a function popAt(int index) which preforms a pop operation at a specific sub-stack.
