/*

Approach 1 ( Fixed Division ) [Simple]

Equally Divide the Array into three equal parts.

+ relitivity simple approach
- One Stack can run out of capacity while others can be empty.

Approach 2 ( Flexible Stack Size ) [Complex]

Circually Linked Array
Shifting nodes when capacity is exceeded.

- Complex approach requiring long bits of code
+ Allows for flexible capacity of the three stacks optimsing for the best memory usage.
